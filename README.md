# 🚀 Introduction

This repository contains the entire source and content for the article series of [30 Days of React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react) hosted by the [Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/) team.

## 👀 What's inside?

## 👩‍🏫 How to use this repository

Each day contains a full React application, following the same procedure used to create the article series. Most days can be run using the same basic steps (and for the days that require a bit more work, check out the tutorial series on the blog).

The steps run any _30 Days of React_ project are:

We can run these steps using the following commands:

```bash
# install the dependencies
yarn install

# start the project
yarn start
```

Since all of the days are built using the fantastic [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool, all of the commands are available from that project in every day.

This repo was written and is maintained by the [Fullstack React](https://fullstackreact.com) team. In the book we cover many more projects like this. We walk through each line of code, explain why it's there and how it works.

_30 Days of React_ covers only the early basics of React. If you're looking to learn how to build real-world React apps, including libraries from the React ecosystem, there's no faster way than by spending a few hours with the Fullstack React book.
